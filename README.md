# Revolutionary-Billiards

This code is the product of the University of Michigan REU 2016, written by Isaac Garfinkle with Dr. Dan Visscher. 

The purpose of this code is for visualization of billiard dynamics on surfaces of revolution. To use this program, the user should first run the HelperFunctions.nb file. Then, they can use tutorial.nb as a guide for creating their own pictures, for research or for fun. Some sample pictures are included for those interested.
